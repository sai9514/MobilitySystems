Optimized Route Modelling and User Choice Modelling for Mobility as a Service Packages

The procedure to run these programs consist of 5 steps:
1. Creating the database from the csv data files downloaded from this site: 
2. Creating a sqlite3 database from these files where each file is a table
3. Running the file runEntireNetwork.py to create the gpickle file after scanning through every route from the sqlite database.

Since we have already run this program, which will take around 16 hours to finish, we have also uploaded the final gpickle file in the github, which is called "networkBerlinNew.gpickle"
